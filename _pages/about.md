Hello,

My name is Florian Pasco, and I'm a master student in Engineering (Electronics, Computer Science and Mechatronics), currently training at the Brest National School of Engineering in France.



Welcome to my portfolio. My portfolio is a website that lists all the projects I've worked on alone or with colleagues. The aim of the portfolio is to give a clear overview of my skills. It also allows you to be redirected to the various web pages and/or documents linked to these projects (github page or technical manual in particular).

Outside the world of technology, I like to improve my skills in a variety of ways. My hobbies range from running to more social activities such as participating in various associations.

I'm also interested in books and reports from the French Polar Institute, self-training, personal development and repairing objects.

I love to travel and discover new things. Both within a short radius, on foot and by bike, but also on expeditions in my car!
