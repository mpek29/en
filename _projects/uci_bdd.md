As part of my course on databases, I had the opportunity to create, in SQLite, a database to manage the riders belonging to the various World Tour teams affiliated to the International Cycling Union.

The concepts addressed during this project are essentially related to data storage, but also to queries. Particular emphasis was placed on associations between the various tables in the database. I was also able to do some UML modeling of my database, to get a better overview.
