During my first year of preparatory studies at the École Nationale d'Ingénieurs de Brest (ENIB), I had the opportunity, with one of my classmates, to create a game called "Cube Course 2D". Cube Course 2D is a platform game in which the player has to stay alive as long as possible.

The aim is to jump from platform to platform, but these are randomly generated, so the player can't easily anticipate them. The player must also watch out for enemies, who are also randomly generated.

The only way to survive enemies?
Jump on their heads, otherwise the player will be destroyed.

The game's concept is inspired by the famous "Geometry Dash" game.
