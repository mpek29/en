Vatn, named after the Old Norse word for water, is a game designed to raise awareness of water management.

In VATN, you have to make a new choice every day to respond to a major problem in your country. This choice causes a variation in the parameters that reflect the state of your country. You can increase or decrease them as the day goes by.

The aim of the game is to keep your country alive for as many days as possible. The country collapses when its population reaches 0.

A main menu lets you start a new game by entering a user name, or resume a previous one using a save file.

A ranking tab at the end of the game allows players to compare their results with those of previous players (the rankings are the result of games played locally).

Finally, during your game, you'll be able to display a summary graph to put into perspective the evolution of the parameters that show the state of your country over the days.

Below are the game's various models:
