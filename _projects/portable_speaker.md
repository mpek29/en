In my spare time, I wanted to put my skills, acquired at Brest National School of Engineering and outside the school, by completing a full open source bluetooth portable speaker project.

As part of this project, I proceeded in 6 stages:
- Drawing up a set block diagram, followed by the system's electronic schematic.
- Testing the circuit on breadbord (basic firmware for testing).
- Design of the system PCB on KiCad.
- Launch of PCB production (via JLCPCB).
- PCB assembly and bench testing.
- Development of firmware in C++ using the Arduino framework and PlatformIO.
- Fusion360 modelling of the entire enclosure.
- 3D printing of the enclosure.
