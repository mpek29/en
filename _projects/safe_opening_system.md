As part of my course on sequential digital circuits, I had the opportunity to build a state machine using D flip-flops and logic gates. This state machine manages the opening and closing of a safe.

The notions covered during this project are: the creation of a state graph, a transition table, a Karnaugh table and the simulation of the system created on LTSpice.
