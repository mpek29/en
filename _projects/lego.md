During my 6th semester at ENIB, I had the opportunity to work on a project aimed at creating the entire Lego catalogue from a single object on Catia using the parameterisation of this part and the addition of rules. So here we had to deal with: the parameterisation of parts, the parameterisation of assemblies, the design of parameterised rules and the creation of a parameterisation table and the associated family of parts.
