During my 4th semester at ENIB, as part of the subject dedicated to programming in the RUST language, we carried out a project for a mini computer music software package with 2 objectives:

- Emphasize the implementation approach, in order to move towards practices (consulting documentation, using a code analyzer, testing code, producing documentation, etc.) that are common in the professional world.

- Understand the life cycle of data manipulated in a program: creation, destruction, consumption, recopying, consultation access, modification access...

The main objective of this project was to create a piece of music from a score in JSON format, which I achieved! However, during the final phase, which consisted in using a MIDI file (much more common in the world of computer music), I wasn't able to finalize the project completely.
