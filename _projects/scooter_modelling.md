During my 6th semester at ENIB, I had the opportunity to work on a project aimed at modelling, simulating and testing the Suzuki Burgman 650 scooter. This involved studying the overall drawings of each element of the system. Then, often using the Newtonâ€™s second law, we modelled each of these elements. Then we made them interact with each other on a simulation carried out with Xcos on Scilab. Finally, we analysed the simulation results to see if they matched the performance announced by the manufacturer.
