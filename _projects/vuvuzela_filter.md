During my 4th semester at ENIB, as part of the course dedicated to second-order analog filters (and more), I had the opportunity to set up an "anti-vuvuzela" filter to attenuate the sound of the vuvuzela.

The Vuvuzela is a musical instrument from South Africa, the sound of which proved to be quite annoying during the 2010 FIFA World Cup in that country.

Starting with original recordings of the World Cup matches, our other project was to preserve the voices of the commentators while eliminating the presence of the vuvuzela.
