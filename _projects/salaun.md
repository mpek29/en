Salaun is a third-person narrative game. I made it as a self-learning project during my high school years (in 2018 to be precise), which was my first concrete experience in computer development.
In this game, the user lives the story of a young Breton who has finished his studies.
His mission is to interact with NPCs and discover different aspects of the game.
This game is graphically inspired by the famous "Unturned" game.

<h3> Game features</h3>

- Cubic/Low Poly! The game has a graphical look close to Unturned.
- Dialogue! Plenty of dialogue to facilitate immersion.
- Exploration! In Salaun, you'll find plenty of characters to talk to as you progress through the story!
