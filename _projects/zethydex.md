In the summer of 2022, I set myself the goal of creating my first mobile app using Android Studio.

Thanks to Android Studio, I created this application using the Kotlin language and SQLite to store all its data.

This application is a utility in which you can create a mini-profile for each of your friends, a bit like a Pok√©Dex! The aim is to record information about your friends (including their apartments and favorite drinks, so you can offer them some when you visit).

This application has been available on the PlayStore in the past. Unfortunately my developer account has been closed due to inactivity and I don't want to incur any further costs for the time being.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/zethydex/1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/zethydex/2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/zethydex/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
