As part of my semester 3 automation course at ENIB, I had the opportunity to automate an industrial assembly line model using a Schneider Electric PLC (Programmable Logic Controller).

Here, the aim was to create a control grafcet and all the cycle grafcets associated with the device, as well as the associated ladder diagrams. The purpose of these grafcets is to propose 3 different control modes: Manual, Automatic and Semi-automatic. This project was also an opportunity to discover how to create and configure a HMI to make it easier to use, and to manage the properties between it and the operator console.
